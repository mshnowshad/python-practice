#> First of all, create a folder where our index.html, CSS, and js files will be present.

#> Now open the PowerShell window in the same directory by pressing right click and shift button together. Choose the Open PowerShell window here.

#> Now type the below command and hit enter to create a server, enter this

""" python -m http.server """



#>> Now open the browser and head over to localhost:8000.

#> Boom! You will see that your server has started, and the files of the directory where you've created your server are being served to you.
# So, that's how you can create your own server within a few minutes with the help of Python. That's all for this tutorial, and I will see you in the next tutorial. Till then, keep coding and keep learning!
